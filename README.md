# Nightly-CPP

I sometimes (when I remember) prompt ChatGPT to generate a small C++ exercise task for me. This isn't something professional‚Äîcoded late night, and I usually just try my best to get it done one way or the other when I realize that it'd be a good idea to go to sleep.  
I'll upload the description ChatGPT (only relevant parts) gave me here, in addition to creating a .cpp file which is my solution (not generated by ChatGPT).  

## Useless Bank (DD/MM/YYYY : 18/06/2025)
Project description:
```md
### üß† **Exercise: Bank Account Management System**

**Objective**: Practice classes, encapsulation, vectors, and basic I/O.

**Description**:
Create a simple bank account management system that allows users to:

1. Create new accounts.
2. Deposit money.
3. Withdraw money.
4. Display account details.
5. Exit the program.

**Requirements**:

* Use a `BankAccount` class with the following private members:

  * `int accountNumber`
  * `std::string ownerName`
  * `double balance`

* Include the following public methods:

  * Constructor to initialize a new account.
  * `void deposit(double amount)`
  * `bool withdraw(double amount)`
  * `void display() const`

* Store multiple accounts using a `std::vector<BankAccount>`.

* Use a simple console menu for user interaction.

---

**Bonus Challenges**:

* Ensure unique account numbers using a static counter.
* Validate inputs (no negative deposits/withdrawals, sufficient balance).
* Implement a search function to find accounts by account number.
```
My final solution after `~35 minutes of work` can be found at `useless-bank.cpp`.

## Primes In Range (DD/MM/YYYY : 17/06/2025)
Project description:
```md
### üîç **Task Description**

Write a C++ program that does the following:

1. **Asks the user to enter two integers `a` and `b`**, where `1 ‚â§ a < b ‚â§ 1000`.
2. **Finds all prime numbers between `a` and `b` (inclusive)**.
3. **Displays the following statistics**:

   * Total number of prime numbers
   * The smallest and largest prime
   * The average (mean) of all the found prime numbers (as a floating-point number)
   * The sum of all the digits of all prime numbers found

---

### üí° **Hints**

* A number `n` is **prime** if it has no divisors other than `1` and `n`.
* Use `std::vector<int>` to store prime numbers.
* Use functions for modular design:

  * `bool isPrime(int n)`
  * `int sumOfDigits(int n)`

---

### üì• **Sample Input**

Enter a: 10
Enter b: 30

### üì§ **Sample Output**

Prime numbers between 10 and 30: 11 13 17 19 23 29
Total primes found: 6
Smallest prime: 11
Largest prime: 29
Average of primes: 18.6667
Sum of all digits in primes: 66

---

### üîß **Requirements**

* Use only the standard C++ library: `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<cmath>`, etc.
* Do not use advanced libraries or third-party headers.
* Code should be split into at least two functions.
```
